## Scatterplot of body mass vs. flipper length:

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species), size = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)", y = "Flipper length (mm)",)

#when only "geom_point()" is used/not separated by species variable: This looks like there is a positive linear relationship between body mass and flipper length across all three penguin species. Aes used specifically for graphing variables based on aesthetics. Not referring to a variable, like size of dots -- outside of "aes()"  

#"~" in facet_Wrap() means as a function of
