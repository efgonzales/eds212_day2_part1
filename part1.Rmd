## Derivatives in R

Find the derivative of $f(x) = 5x^2$ (use "\$" Latex coding language? to format as equation)

```{r}
ex_1 <- expression(5 * x ^ 2) #after running, it will show up in environment. "expression()" generic placeholder...creates unevaluated expression to feed into function (deriv func can use expression)
?expression

my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x") #"x" tells R to take the derivative with respect to x
my_derivative

#Find the slope at x = 2.8
x <- 2.8
eval(my_derivative)

```

Find the slope of $g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * z ^ 3 - 10.5 * z ^ 2 + 4.1)

dg_dz <- D(gz, "z") # "D()" works the same as "deriv()"
dg_dz

#Evaluate the slope over a range of values.
z <- seq(from = -3, to = 4, by = 0.5)
eval(dg_dz)


```
